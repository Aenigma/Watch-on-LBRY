# Watch on LBRY

A plugin for web browsers that automatically checks whether a YouTube video or channel is on LBRY. If it is, it redirects you to LBRY to watch it there.

## Installation

## For Chrome:
Visit ```chrome://extensions``` (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.
## For Firefox
To install an extension temporarily:

The extension will be installed, and will stay installed until you restart Firefox.


## Usage

Go to YouTube in your browser. When you load a video or channel, it will detect if it's also uploaded to the LBRY Network and the it will move you to open.lbry.com so you can watch the video on LBRY (either on the web or in the app)!
